function matrix = m20130226_06_FourierSpectralInterpolationMatrix(N, x)

% Assumes data are known on the points (k-1)*2*pi/N,  k = 1...N.
% (so first point is 0).

% N = number of points on which the data are known.
% x = new points onto which we wish to interpolate.

%  The function t = fourint(fk, x) computes the trigonometric interpolant
%  of the data (xk, fk), where xk are equidistant nodes.
%
%  Input:
%  fk:  Vector of y-coordinates of data, at equidistant points 
%       x(k) = (k-1)*2*pi/N,  k = 1...N.
%  x:   Vector of x-values where interpolant is to be evaluated.
%
%  Output:
%  t:    Vector of interpolated values.
%
%  The code implements the barycentric formula; see page 46 in
%  P. Henrici, Applied and Computational Complex Analysis III, Wiley, 1986.
%  (Note that if some fk > 1/eps, with eps the machine epsilon,
%  the value of eps in the code may have to be reduced.)
